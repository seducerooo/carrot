                <h4>Online Multi-Channel Listing </h4>
                <p>Marketplace Multi-Channel Listing is becoming one of the vital aspects of inventory management systems as customers do not like to navigate in and out between multiple applications and platforms such as their inventory management system, AMAZON and eBay, and End-users would like these applications to talk to each other and provide flexibility to complete the tasks within one application.
                    <br><br>Bright Inventory Online Multi-Channel Listing would give you this flexibility to avoid having multiple accounts in multiple platforms and control everything from just one platform by using real time data.
                    <br><br> You might want to add this to your plan or use it as stand alone product and add to your existing Inventory Management System.
